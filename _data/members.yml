  description: "Junfeng obtained his PhD at Analytical Chemistry from Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. There he worked on the construction of integrated proteomics platforms based on chromatography and mass spectrometry techniques.  
  
  
  Junfeng did his post-doc training with Dr. Gerald Hart at the Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His work focused on the developing methods for analysis of protein O-GlcNAcylation in diverse disease conditions. Besides O-GlcNAcylation, he was also interested in exploring proteomics methods for other post-translational modifications (including N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and phosphorylation).
  

  After joining Georgetown University, Junfeng continues his research interest in the bioanalytical charactionaion and functional elucidation of protein O-GlcNAcylation in diseases (including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases). He also directs the proteomics core lab to provide diverse proteomic services to investigators in and outside of Georgetown University."
