  description: "Eli received his Ph.D. in [Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/) from [UCSF](http://www.ucsf.edu/) in 2009. There, he worked in [Kevan Shokat's](http://shokatlab.ucsf.edu/) lab studying the role of PI3K signaling in [insulin response](/publications#16647110), [cancer](/publications#22802621), and [drug resistance](/publications#18691552).


  Eli did his postdoc in [Garry Nolan's](http://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) lab at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/). There, he developed a [cell barcoding method](/publications#25612231) for [mass cytometry](https://www.fluidigm.com/products/cytof) that he used to study [kinase inhibitor specificity across the human immune system](/publications#22902532), developed a graph-based mapping algorithm to [track iPS cell reprogramming](/publications#25748935) and [identify early reprogramming intermediates](/publications#25830878), and applied these generalizable methods to map [AML patient samples by prognosis](/publications#26095251) and [organism-level organization of the mouse immune system](/publications#26160952).


  In January 2016, Eli began his independent career as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](http://bme.virginia.edu/) at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/)."
